diffrent between if condition & switch case ?
    if     >> use operators less than switch cause it work during runtime time
    switch >> work with integr characters and can not use operators speed than if cause it work during compile time

    time to use switch ?
        when i had equality
    time to use if     ?
        any case

    Ternary Operator ?
       z = (expresstion) ? "" : ""
        so easy
        so important for function programming
        let me save function inside one variable

    prefix and postfix ?
        // no diffrence in any case but 1
        // int x = 5;
        // postfix
        // z = x++
        // mean
        // z = 5 then++
        cout = z=5, x=6

        // prefix
        // z = x++
        // mean
        // z = ++ then 5
        cout = z=6, x=6
    what's diffrent between overloading and overwriting?

    overloading is concept in programing allow us to make two function with same
    name but with diffrent numbers of params / types / order.
